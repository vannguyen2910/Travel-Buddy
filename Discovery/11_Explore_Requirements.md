## 1. Overview

The Explore tab is the primary entry point of Travel Buddy. It is the first surface a user encounters — including unauthenticated guests — and the main reason they return between trips. Its purpose is to help travelers discover authentic, peer-sourced places and experiences, without relying on commercial listings or opaque ratings.

The Explore experience offers three discovery modes: **Near Me** (location-aware default feed), **by Country** (destination-first inspiration), and **by Map** (spatial/proximity-based discovery). All three modes share a unified filter system, crowd signal layer, and one-tap save action connecting discovery directly to trip planning.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Travelers currently use 8–10 separate apps per trip because no single platform combines discovery, trustworthy peer context, and planning in one place (P1 interview, Jun 2026; H3 confirmed). Existing platforms like TripAdvisor and Google Maps are perceived as commercially biased — users distrust aggregate ratings and cannot tell whether a recommendation came from someone who travels like them (H1 confirmed, n=13 survey).

Travel Buddy's Explore experience must solve two problems simultaneously:

1. **Trust gap** — Surface tips with visible traveler identity and travel style so users can apply their own trust logic, not just a star average.
2. **Fragmentation gap** — Connect discovery directly to planning (save to shortlist in one tap) so users never need to switch apps to act on what they find.

---

## 3. Goals

### 3.1 User Goals
- Find authentic, non-commercial travel tips that match their travel style
- Understand a place's crowd level and safety context before visiting
- Save anything interesting to a trip plan without leaving the discovery flow
- Browse freely without being forced to create an account

### 3.2 Product Goals
- Demonstrate core value to a new user within the first session (before sign-up)
- Drive conversion from guest to registered user via save and connect actions
- Establish Travel Buddy as the single place where discovery and planning coexist

### 3.3 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time to first tip interaction (tap or save) | < 30 seconds from app open |
| Guest-to-registered conversion rate via Explore | ≥ 25% of guests who tap Save |
| Tips saved per session (registered users) | ≥ 2 per session |
| Filter usage rate | ≥ 40% of active users apply at least one filter per week |
| Mode switch rate (Country → Map → List) | Tracked; no target for v1, used for IA validation post-launch |

---

## 4. Users & Personas

| Persona | Primary need in Explore | Primary mode |
|---------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Aisha — Explorer / Pragmatic Planner** | Research a destination thoroughly before committing; avoid tourist traps; build a structured shortlist from peer tips | Near Me (filtered by Explorer style) + Country drill-down |
| **Ji-yeon — Social Connector** | Find where other travelers and locals hang out; discover human connection opportunities alongside places | Near Me (filtered by Local life) + Map |
| **Documenter** | Browse for inspiration; save things that feel worth revisiting; low-intent browsing | Country (inspiration-first) |
| **Guest (unauthenticated)** | Explore without commitment; see what the app offers before signing up | All modes, read-only |

---

## 5. Scope

### In Scope — v1
- Explore tab with three discovery modes: **Near Me** (default, location-aware), **Country** (browse beyond current location), **Map** (spatial). Near Me is the intelligent default; Country and Map are how users expand outward. Within Country mode, search or manual country selection is a secondary action — contextual destination suggestions are shown first
- Shared filter system (travel style, category, timing)
- Crowd signal badge on all tips (D3)
- Video snippet badge and player (D4)
- Safety context panel (D5)
- One-tap save to shortlist (P3) with guest sign-up gate
- Guest browsing access to all three modes (A4)
- Tip detail screen with Details / Video / Safety tabs

### Out of Scope — v1
- User-generated tip submission (post-launch)
- Offline map caching in Explore (offline access is scoped to Plan tab, P4)
- Paid or promoted tips
- Social following (follow a traveler, see their feed) — post-launch
- Collaborative real-time exploration with companions (post-launch)
- Search by tip text / full-text search (post-launch; v1 has destination search only)

## 9. Dependencies

| Dependency | Required for | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| `10_Prototype_Plan.md` design system | All screens | ✅ Ready |
| `07_Solution_Pool.md` D1–D5 definitions | Feature requirements | ✅ Ready |
| Crowd signal data model | ED3 requirements | 🔲 To be defined |
| Safety notes data model | ED5 requirements | 🔲 To be defined |
| Card sort results (`09_Card_Sorting_IA.md`) | Tab label finalisation (Explore vs. Discover) | 🔲 Pending |
| Real Unsplash photo URLs | Prototype visual fidelity | 🔲 To be sourced |

---

## 10. Open Questions

| # | Question | Owner | Due |
|---|----------|-------|-----|
| 1 | Should "Explore" be the final tab label, or will card sort results suggest a different word (e.g. "Discover", "Find")? | Winnie | After card sort |
| 2 | Is the crowd signal a user-reported metric, an algorithmic score, or both? Data model needs to be defined before backend spec | TBD | Pre-wireframe |
| 3 | What is the minimum number of tips needed for a destination to appear in Country mode? Avoid showing destinations with 1–2 tips | TBD | Pre-launch |
| 4 | Should the Map mode default to the user's current location or their saved trip destination? | Winnie | Usability test |
| 5 | Video content — is this traveler-uploaded, curated by Travel Buddy, or both in v1? Affects content strategy significantly | TBD | Product strategy |
